Answer:
WITH 
dated_transactions AS 
  (SELECT CAST(transaction_date AS date) AS transdate, amount, type 
  FROM transactions),
transaction_info AS 
  (SELECT transdate, 
          SUM(CASE 
              WHEN type='deposit' THEN amount 
              WHEN type='withdrawal' THEN -amount 
              END) AS total_amount
  FROM dated_transactions
  GROUP BY transdate
  ORDER BY transdate)

SELECT transdate AS transaction_day,
      SUM(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transdate) ORDER BY transdate) AS balance
FROM transaction_info
GROUP BY transdate, total_amount
ORDER BY transdate;
