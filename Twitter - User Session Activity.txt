WITH info AS 
(SELECT user_id, session_type, SUM(duration) as total_duration
FROM sessions
WHERE start_date BETWEEN TO_DATE('01/01/2022', 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS') 
AND TO_DATE('02/01/2022', 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS')
GROUP BY user_id, session_type)

SELECT user_id, session_type, 
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY session_type ORDER BY total_duration DESC) 
FROM info;
