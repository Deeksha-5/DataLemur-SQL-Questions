Question:
Assume you are given the following tables on Walmart transactions and products. Find the number of unique product combinations that are bought together (purchased in the same transaction).
For example, if I find two transactions where apples and bananas are bought, and another transaction where bananas and soy milk are bought, my output would be 2 to represent the 2 unique combinations. Your output should be a single number.

Assumption:
For each transaction, a maximum of 2 products is purchased.

transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
product_id	integer
user_id	integer
transaction_date	datetime

transactions Example Input:
transaction_id	product_id	user_id	transaction_date
231574	111	234	03/01/2022 12:00:00
231574	444	234	03/01/2022 12:00:00
231574	222	234	03/01/2022 12:00:00
137124	111	125	03/05/2022 12:00:00
137124	444	125	03/05/2022 12:00:00

products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_name	string

products Example Input:

333	instant oatmeal
444	banana
555	chia seed

Example Output:
combo_num
4

Explanation:
There are 4 unique purchase combinations present in the example data.
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Answer:
WITH product_details AS (SELECT transactions.transaction_id, transactions.product_id, transactions.user_id, products.product_name 
    FROM transactions JOIN products ON transactions.product_id=products.product_id)
SELECT p1.product_name, p2.product_name, count(*) AS combo_num
FROM product_details p1 FULL OUTER JOIN product_details p2 
ON p1.transaction_id=p2.transaction_id
WHERE p1.product_id>p2.product_id
GROUP BY p1.product_name, p2.product_name
LIMIT 3;
