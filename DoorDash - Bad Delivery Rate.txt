WITH info AS 
(SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM signup_timestamp)=6
AND CAST(order_timestamp AS DATE)-CAST(signup_timestamp AS DATE)<=14)


SELECT 
ROUND(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN status='completed incorrectly' OR status='never received'
        THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END)*100.0/COUNT(*)*1.0, 2)
FROM info;
