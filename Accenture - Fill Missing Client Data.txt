Question:
When you log in to your retailer client's database, you notice that their product catalog data is full of gaps in the category column. Can you write a SQL query that returns the product catalog with the missing data filled in?

Assumptions:
Each category is mentioned only once in a category column.
All the products belonging to same category are grouped together.
The first product from a product group will always have a defined category.
Meaning that the first item from each category will not have a missing category value.

products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
category	varchar
name	varchar

products Example Input:
product_id	category	name
1	Shoes	Sperry Boat Shoe
2		Adidas Stan Smith
3		Vans Authentic
4	Jeans	Levi 511
5		Wrangler Straight Fit
6	Shirts	Lacoste Classic Polo
7		Nautica Linen Shirt

Example Output:
product_id	category	name
1	Shoes	Sperry Boat Shoe
2	Shoes	Adidas Stan Smith
3	Shoes	Vans Authentic
4	Jeans	Levi 511
5	Jeans	Wrangler Straight Fit
6	Shirts	Lacoste Classic Polo
7	Shirts	Nautica Linen Shirt

Explanation:
Shoes will replace all NULL values below the product Sperry Boat Shoe until Jeans appears. Similarly, Jeans will replace NULLs for the product Wrangler Straight Fit, and so on.
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Answer:
WITH new AS (SELECT  *, COUNT(category) OVER (ORDER BY product_id) AS uid
    FROM products)
SELECT product_id, first_value(category) OVER(PARTITION BY uid) as category, name
FROM new;
